            Ok I think doing you're favotire animal is kind of boring and honestly, I can really think of one. So I decided to do something a little diggerent, I'm going to do a page about one of my favotire Fictional beasts the Rajang.
            The Rajang is a large Ape like Fanged Beast from capcoms Monster Hunter franchise, it closely resembles most great apes such as the Gorilla, much like it's real world primal counter part the Rajang is known best for it's immense upper body strength,
            being able to uproot trees in one swift motion and toss large bolders twice it's size with ease. The key traits of a Rajang are it's two bull like horns and it's lion like tail, however arguably the most striking physical feature of the Rajang is
            it's ability to conduct electricity from it's mouth and hands in concentrated burst, upon becoming enraged the Rajangs normally brown pelt turns a bright golden yellow instantly signify it's increased strength and savagry, this transfromation however
            can be negated by clipping the tuft of fur at the base of the beasts tail however this is extremely hard to do due to it's small size and surprising endurance. Nomadic in nature Rajang prefer to live solitary live hunting their elusive pray the Kirin
            with extreme prejadice, although due to it's wild nature they are rarely sucessful.
